# Supabase Polls

Simple app to create and vote on polls.
Built with React, Chakra UI and Supabase ❤️ during the [Launch Week 5 Hackathon](https://supabase.com/blog/launch-week-5-hackathon).

This is my first React project (I'm used to Vue), so it will be messy in places.

## Features

* Create a poll with up to five choices, optionally allow multiple-choice votes.
* Results page with multiple visualizations and realtime updates.
* Support both anonymous and authenticated poll creation and votes.

## Planned Features

* Bot-protections using Captcha, an IP record table and user sessions.
* Authenticated users will be able to manage their created polls.
* Dunno, maybe more.
